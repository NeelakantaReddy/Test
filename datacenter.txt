Datacenter notes.

Registering message points to note.

the channel name is limited to 20 alphanumeric characters.
the message body is limited to 200 characters.
registering a message consumer does not prevent it being garbage collected, it is the responsibility of the plugin to maintain a reference to it as long as it is needed.
if a node is unavailable or in the process of being restarted, it will not process any messages sent during the time it was offline.
while the id of the sender is exposed to the message consumer it is best to avoid relying on any particular node being available.
